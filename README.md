This script attempts to crack the ZIP file by generating all possible combinations of letters and digits of varying lengths. It starts with one-character passwords and gradually increases the length until it finds the correct password or exhausts all possibilities. Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-world ZIP file cracking can be much more challenging.

Keep in mind that attempting to crack passwords without permission or for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the appropriate authorization and follow ethical guidelines when dealing with password-protected files.
